# Installing

For most users it is recommended that you use [the launcher](via-launcher.md) to install and run Recaf. The launcher will automatically download the correct JavaFX artifacts for your system, allow you to pick which installed version of Java to use when running Recaf, and provide easy single-click access to updates.

For technical users that do not wish to use the launcher, you can follow the [manual installation](via-manual.md) guide.
