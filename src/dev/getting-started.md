# Getting Started

## For plugin development

Most of what you need should be covered by:

- [CDI](arch/cdi.md)
  - This page talks about how injection is used in Recaf, which is used to access features within Recaf.
- [Services](services/index.html)
  - This page links to the lists of different scoped services / features.
- [Plugins](plugins-and-scripts/plugins.md)
  - This page talks about how to write plugins.

## For contributing to Recaf directly

Contributing can cover a number of different tasks.

If you want to see what bugs need to be fixed and what features we want to add, visit the [Recaf issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/issues).

If you want to contribute documentation, visit the [Recaf site project on GitHub](https://github.com/Col-E/recaf-site).
