# Getting Started

Recaf requires Java 22 or above. If you do not have this version or higher installed, we recommend you install it from [Adoptium, an Eclipse Foundation project](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22&package=jdk).

## Contributing to Recaf

Some pages you should read up on first:

- [Building](arch/building.md) - This page explains how to build and run Recaf.
- [Important Libraries](arch/important-libraries.md) - This page talks about the most relevant libraries you should know about that are used in Recaf.
- [Workspace model](workspace-model/index.html) - This page talks about how the `Workspace` model works in Recaf.
- [CDI](arch/cdi.md) - This page talks about how injection is used in Recaf, which is used to access features within Recaf.
- [Services](services/index.html) - This page lists all of the services / features that Recaf provides.

To find things to work on such as bugs and new features, visit the [Recaf issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/issues) _(Or search the source code for `TODO` comments, plenty of those are scattered around and aren't tied to any specific issue)_.

If you want to contribute documentation, visit the [Recaf site project on GitHub](https://github.com/Col-E/recaf-site).

## Plugin development

The [Plugins](plugins-and-scripts/plugins.md) page talks about how to write plugins. A template workspace is linked there for you to work off of.
