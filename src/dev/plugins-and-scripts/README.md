# Plugins & Scripts

- [Plugins](plugins.md) - Plugins are containers which can integrate with any of Recaf's services, can be loaded/unloaded, and are started when Recaf opens by default.
- [Scripts](scripts.md) - Scripts are small one-shot actions that can be as simple or complex as you want, so long as it all fits in a single Java source file. They're basically small plugins that are only run when the user requests them to.
